How to go from raw 16S rRNA gene sequencing reads to biologically informative data and figures

## 16S rRNA Analysis Overview: 

A general overview of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses: 
I will provide information on all the steps below in the lecture, but the hands-on sessions will largely focus on library size normalization, calculating ecological distance, and generating ordination/relative abundance plots as these methods are universal techniques often used in microbial ecology analyses

## Dataset to be analyzed: 

Ecological dynamics of the gut microbiome in response to dietary fiber: Liu et al., 2022 (ISME): https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-022-01253-4#code-availability
Raw read files deposited in NCBI SRA: PRJNA754019

A (relatively simple) and interesting 16S dataset!

To simplify the dataset we will only work with a fraction of samples: time 0, time 5, time 13 and time 31. (Samples from Hunan are also removed here)
