# Resources 

Rather than a one-size-fits-all, bioinformatics projects are inherently patchwork in nature! 

You'll need to use an assortment of tools, techniques and resources to analyze your data. I've compiled resources (16S-specific and beyond) that I've personally found helpful.
Bioinformatics techniques are ever-evolving, so this is just a drop in the bucket



# Using and installing R
By Laura Camelo, McGill University

**Note - There are resources below for those that are new to R. If you don't feel comfortable using R/can't get the installation to work, you'll be paired with someone who has R experience and it installed properly. 



## What is R?
R is a free programming environment that integrates tools to perform manipulation
of data, statistical calculations and generation of graphs.
To use R it is necessary to download the programming language and binary files to control
its use in the desired operating system. Subsequently, it is recommended to download RStudio which is
an application (Integrated Development Environment) that allows you to use the programming language
in an easier and more organized way (e.g. code editor, graphics panels, visualization of the
variables).

## How to install R and R studio 

For users new to R, you'll want to install both R and R studio on your computer before the first class: [Instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)




## Resources for R begginers

1)  [Video tutorial helpful for syntax and basic R programming:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8BISK5DpM)

2) A nice (and slightly more advanced) tutorial by Laura Camelo on how to process RNA-seq data using R. Good for understanding syntax, data types, and visualization.




## Useful R packages

Phyloseq:  [Documentation:](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/)
- Generally one of the most commonly used R packages for microbial ecology projects
- Integrates statistical, visualization, and general microbial ecology pipelines
- We will use this extensively in the hands-on session!

Vegan: [Documentation:](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vegan.pdf)
- Community ecology package
- Specifically useful for ordination and calculating diversity



## Qiime2: 
- [Documentation:](https://use.qiime2.org/en/latest/intro.html)
 - A microbiome platform with easy-to-use commands and data types
 - Really good if you're new to bioinformatics - lots of easy to follow documentation,tutorials, and active support on forums (really good resource for  microbial ecology/16S stuff in general)
 - A bit restrictive for more experienced users, but I still use qiime2 for upstream data processing (see data pre-processing section)


  
## Miscellaneous 

- Riffomonas (Pat Schloss) - [Documentation:](https://www.youtube.com/@Riffomonas) - Lots of microbiome-specific videos on microbiome analyses 
- StatQuest (Josh Starmer) - [Documentation:](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) - Particuarily helpful for ecology and stats-related things
- Bioinformatics Data Skills (Vince Buffalo) - A book! - From 2015, but holds up really well, particularily for project management
